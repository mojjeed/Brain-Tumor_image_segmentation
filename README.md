## üìà Model Performance Analysis

### üîç Dice Coefficient (Left Graph)

The **Dice Coefficient** measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentation masks. A score of **1** indicates perfect segmentation.

- **Training Dice**: 0.55 ‚Üí 0.87 (Strong improvement over 20 epochs)
- **Validation Dice**: 0.52 ‚Üí 0.84 (Good generalization to unseen data)

This indicates that the model effectively learns tumor features and generalizes well to new data.

### üìâ Loss (Right Graph)

**Loss Function**: Custom **Dice Loss**, optimized for segmentation tasks with pixel-level class imbalances.

- **Training Loss**: 0.68 ‚Üí 0.19
- **Validation Loss**: 0.70 ‚Üí 0.235

The **loss curve** shows consistent convergence with minimal overfitting, suggesting that the optimizer (Adam) effectively trained the model.
